func - > hit number(value)
	check if previous button press was number ---> global var counter = 0,1
	if yes (1) ->>> update storage number as concatenation of storage and value
	if no & it is 1st button press since clear or new (ie -> if 0 && operand == '') 
		-> store number as string and increment counter to 1
	if no (0) and operand +! 0
		convert storage to num
		storage = previousstorageconverted +/-/%/- value inputted
	update display with stored number
	

func -> hit operand (operandValue)
	if operand === "" (ie - is first pressed operand in session)
		set operand storage as operandValue
	



func = button ---> 
	reset increment counter to 0 & operand storage to ""
